Description: Code-Sculpture consists of java programs and implementation of core java and OOPS concepts. It is a practice where it helps to build the knowledge on core java and helps in developing problem solving skills. This repository contains various range of programs from basics. You can find Euler programs, Bench mark Programs, Fun Facts, own projects etc,.

Software: Eclipse Neon.2. Release (4.6.2)

Installation Instructions: Download JDK 8 from oracle and install in your system. Later download Eclipse Neon from Eclipse website. Then install Exclipse and follow the instructions and install Eclipse and create your own workspace where u can write all your programs.

and more..

You can also find OOPS concepts like Inheritance, method overloading and overriding, exception handling, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Encapsulation. 
Further various core java concepts have also been covered such as String handling, I/Oprograms, Exception Handling, Enumeration Concepts, Design Patterns, Collections Concept covering ArrayList,List,HaspMap,Maps,Map.entry,Sets,LinkedLists etc.
