##**Java Basics, OOPS concepts and Core Java:**  
>
Here you can find various programs which are organized on weekly basis with daily commits. The OOPS concepts and Core Java concepts are covered in every program.  
The OOPS concepts covered are  
* Inheritance- Method Overloading and OverRiding
* Exception Handling 
* Polymorphism
* Abstraction
* Encapsulation.  

Further various core java concepts have also been covered n programs such as 
* String handling
* Interfaces
* Packages
* Multi-Threading
* I/Oprograms
* Exception Handling
* Enumeration Concepts
* Design Patterns
* Collections Framework covering 
 * ArrayList
 * List
